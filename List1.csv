Dirigeante entrepreneure n’ayant pas peur de rassembler et faire grandir ses troupes autour d’une vision d’une culture et d’un défi aussi grand soit-il. Pour générer de la valeur et innover il nous faut des employés des fournisseurs et des partenaires qui croient au plan de match. Pour se faire: une vision rassembleuse et une communication claire sentie et transparente.Je trouve ma zone de performance à relever les défis un à un tout en laissant briller l’entreprise et les équipes qui m'entourent. L'expérience m'a appris que d'arriver à insuffler un esprit de dépassement et de saine compétition ouvre les portes du succès et permet des relations fortes et durables. J'ai le privilège de cumuler une grande connaissance du monde des communications-marketing de l'industrie agro-alimentaire du commerce de détail et des produits de consommation. Au fil des 23 dernières années j’ai accompagné d’importantes compagnies tant au niveau local national et international désirant percer ici ou ailleurs au pays.Que ce soit au sein de mes propres entreprises pendant mon passage dans une PME familiale du Québec ou dans l'une des plus grandes agences publicitaires au pays avec plus de 90 clients sous ma supervision j’ai toujours dû et su trouver des solutions pour livrer au-delà des attentes - avec peu et pour hier. Aucun obstacle n'est trop grand. Il n'est qu'une opportunité de démontrer qu'avec du coeur et en équipe peut tout bâtir et tout accomplir.

Avec simultanément 90 clients actifs sous ma supervision et de grandes équipes et en plus du volet ventes/comm/marketing j’ai aiguisé mes aptitudes et ma plume pour tout ce qui englobe les communications corporatives le développement de la culture et des talents la gestion de personnel et du changement. Aujourd’hui je conseille des entreprises dans leur développement les appuie dans leurs enjeux d’affaires tout en les supportant dans leur management et leurs initiatives marketing. Ma force: projeter vitesse Grand V dans la tête du C-suite pour non seulement comprendre ses enjeux et trouver des solutions optimales mais lui insuffler le souffle nécessaire pour passer au prochain niveau.Au plaisir d’avancer ensembleCaroline M.
